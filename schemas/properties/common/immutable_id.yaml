  type:
    - "string"
  description: |-
    The entry's immutable ID (e.g., a UUID).

    This is important for databases having preferred IDs that point to "the latest version" of a record, but still offer access to older variants. This ID maps to the version-specific record, in case it changes in the future.

    Requirements/Conventions:
    - Taken together, the ID and entry type MUST uniquely identify the entry.
    - Reasonably short IDs are encouraged and SHOULD NOT be longer than 255 characters.
    - IDs MAY change over time.
    - Strings that are not URL-safe are allowed.
  examples:
    - "8bd3e750-b477-41a0-9b11-3a799f21b44f"
    - "fjeiwoj,54;@=%<>#32"
