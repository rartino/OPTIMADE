  type:
    - "array"
    - "null"
  description: |-
    The chemical symbols of the different elements present in the structure.

    Requirements/Conventions:
    - The strings are the chemical symbols, i.e., either a single uppercase letter or an uppercase letter followed by a number of lowercase letters.
    - The order MUST be alphabetical.
    - MUST refer to the same elements in the same order, and therefore be of the same length, as elements_ratios, if the latter is provided.
    - Note: This property SHOULD NOT contain the string "X" to indicate non-chemical elements or "vacancy" to indicate vacancies (in contrast to the field chemical_symbols for the species property).

    Queryinig:
    - A filter that matches all records of structures that contain Si, Al and O, and possibly other elements: elements HAS ALL "Si", "Al", "O".
    - To match structures with exactly these three elements, use elements HAS ALL "Si", "Al", "O" AND elements LENGTH 3.
    - Note: length queries on this property can be equivalently formulated by filtering on the nelements property directly.
  examples:
    - ["Si"]
    - ["Al","O","Si"]
