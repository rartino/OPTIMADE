  The litre, or liter is a unit of volume equal to a cubic decimetre (1 dm³) using the current, or one of the historical, definitions of the SI units.

  "The 12th Conférence Générale des Poids et Mesures (CGPM) [...] declares that the word 'litre' may be employed as a special name for the cubic decimetre" [12th CGPM meeting (1964), resolution 6].

  The litre was defined at the 12th CGPM meeting in 1964, resolution 6, and implicitly redefined with the redefinition of the metre at the 17th CGPM Meeting in 1983, resolution 1.

  This is a generalized definition taken to reference the current, or one of the historical, SI unit definitions.
  This definition is intended for situations when it is not possible to be more precise, e.g., in contexts where data have been collected that uses different historical SI definitions.
