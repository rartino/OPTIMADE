description: |-
  A unit for electrical conductance equal to kg⁻¹·m⁻²·s³·A² using the current, or one of the historical, definitions of the SI units.

  "The International Committee will ask the General Conference to approve two special names: [...] siemens (symbol S) for the SI unit of conductance (Ω⁻¹)." [14th CGPM Meeting (1971)].

  The siemens was defined at the 14th CGPM Meeting in 1971 and implicitly redefined via the redefinitions of the meter at the 17th CGPM Meeting in 1983, resolution 1 and the kilogram at the 26th CGPM Meeting (2018), resolution 1.

  This is a generalized definition taken to reference the current, or one of the historical, SI unit definitions.
  This definition is intended for situations when it is not possible to be more precise, e.g., in contexts where data have been collected that uses different historical SI definitions.
