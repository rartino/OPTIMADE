description: |-
  A derived SI unit for electrical conductance equal to kg⁻¹·m⁻²·s³·A² using the 1983 SI base units.

  "The International Committee will ask the General Conference to approve two special names: [...] siemens (symbol S) for the SI unit of conductance (Ω⁻¹)." [14th CGPM Meeting (1971)].

  The siemens was defined at the 14th CGPM Meeting in 1971 and implicitly redefined via the redefinition of the meter at the 17th CGPM Meeting in 1983, resolution 1.
