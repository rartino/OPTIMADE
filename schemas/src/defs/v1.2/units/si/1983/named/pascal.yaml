description: |-
  A derived SI unit for pressure and stress equal to kg·m⁻¹·s⁻² using the 1983 SI units.

  "The International Committee will ask the General Conference to approve two special names: pascal (symbol Pa) for the SI unit of pressure (N/m²), [...]" [14th CGPM Meeting (1971)].

  The pascal was defined at the 14th CGPM Meeting in 1971 and implicitly redefined via the redefinition of the metre at the 17th CGPM Meeting in 1983, resolution 1.
