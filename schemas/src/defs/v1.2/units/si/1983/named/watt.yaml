description: |-
  A derived SI unit for power and radiant flux equal to kg·m²·s⁻³ in the 1983 SI units.

  "The watt is the power that produces one joule per second." [9th CGPM meeting in 1946]

  The watt was defined at the 9th CGPM Meeting in 1946, included in SI at the 11th CGPM meeting in 1960, resolution 12, implicitly redefined via the redefinition of the second at the 13th CGPM Meeting in 1967, resolution 1, and again implicitly redefined via the redefinition of the metre at the 17th CGPM meeting (1983), resolution 1.
