description: |-
  A derived SI unit for inductance equal to kg·m²·s⁻²·A⁻² in the 1983 SI units.

  "The henry is the inductance of a closed circuit in which an electromotive force of one volt is produced when the electric current passing through the circuit varies uniformly at a rate of one ampere per second." [9th CGPM meeting in 1946]

  The henry was defined at the 9th CGPM Meeting in 1946, included in SI at the 11th CGPM meeting in 1960, resolution 12, implicitly redefined via the redefinition of the second at the 13th CGPM Meeting in 1967, resolution 1, and again implicitly redefined via the redefinition of the metre at the 17th CGPM meeting (1983), resolution 1.
