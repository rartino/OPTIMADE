description: |-
  The kelvin is the SI base unit of thermodynamic temperature defined from the triple point of water at the 13th CGPM Meeting in 1967, resolution 3 and 4 and clarified at the 23rd CGPM Meeting in 2007, resolution 10.

  The definition is functionally the same as the prior definition of degree Kelvin from the 10th CGPM meeting in 1954.
  However, at the 13th CGPM Meeting in 1967, resolution 4, the definition was rephrased as: "The kelvin, unit of thermodynamic temperature, is the fraction 1/273.16 of the thermodynamic temperature of the triple point of water."
  In this defining text, and as decided in resolution 3, the unit is named kelvin with the symbol K, replacing the prior use of degree Kelvin and variations.

  The 23rd CGPM meeting in 2007, resolution 10, approved to append a clarification to the above definition: "This definition refers to water having the isotopic composition defined by the following amount-of-substance ratios: 0.00015576 mole of ²H per mole of ¹H, 0.0003799 mole of ¹⁷O per mole of ¹⁶O and 0.0020052 mole of ¹⁸O per mole of ¹⁶O."
