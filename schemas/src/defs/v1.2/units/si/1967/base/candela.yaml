  The candela is the SI base unit of luminous intensity in a given direction defined in from the radiation of a black body at the temperature of freezing platinum as defined at the 9th CGPM meeting in 1948, clarified at the 13th CGPM Meeting in 1967, resolution 5; and implicitly redefined due to the 1967 SI redefinition of the second.

  At the 13th CGPM Meeting in 1967, resolution 5 the previous definition from the 9th CGPM meeting in 1948 was rephrased to be more clear: "The candela is the luminous intensity, in the perpendicular direction, of a surface of 1/600000 square metre of a black body at the temperature of freezing platinum under a pressure of 101325 newtons per square metre."

  Furthermore, the SI 1967 definition of the candela references:

  - the SI 1960 metre (https://schemas.optimade.org/defs/v1.2/units/si/1960/base/metre).
  - the SI 1967 derived newton unit (https://schemas.optimade.org/defs/v1.2/units/si/1967/named/newton) equal to kilogram·metre·second⁻², referencing the SI 1960 kilogram (https://schemas.optimade.org/defs/v1.2/units/si/1960/base/kilogram) and metre (https://schemas.optimade.org/defs/v1.2/units/si/1960/base/metre); and the 1967 definition of the second (https://schemas.optimade.org/defs/v1.2/units/si/1967/base/second).
