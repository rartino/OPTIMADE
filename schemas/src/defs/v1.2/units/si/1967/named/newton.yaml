  The newton is a derived SI unit for force and weight equal to kg·m·s⁻² in 1967 SI units.

  "The newton is the force that, in one second, imparts to a mass equal to one kilogram an increase in speed of one meter per second." [9th CGPM meeting in 1946]

  The newton was defined at the 9th CGPM Meeting in 1946, included in SI at the 11th CGPM meeting in 1960, resolution 12 and implicitly redefined via the redefinition of the second at the 13th CGPM Meeting in 1967, resolution 1.
