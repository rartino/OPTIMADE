description: |-
  A derived SI unit of temperature, defined as degree kelvin offset with +273.15 in the SI base units adopted at the 11th CGPM Meeting in 1960.

  "If we add to the practical international Celsius temperatures defined above T₀ = 273.15 degrees, we obtain the practical international Kelvin temperatures. By subtracting T₀ from the thermodynamic temperatures, we obtain the thermodynamic Celsius temperatures." [11th CGPM meeting (1960)]
