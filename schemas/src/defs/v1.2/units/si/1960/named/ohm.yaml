description: |-
  A derived SI unit for electrical resistance equal to kg·m²·s⁻³·A⁻² in the 1960 SI base units.

  "The ohm is the electrical resistance that exists between two points of a conductor when a constant potential difference of one volt, applied between these two points, produces a current of one ampere in the conductor, provided that the conductor is not the seat of any electromotive force." [9th CGPM meeting in 1946]
