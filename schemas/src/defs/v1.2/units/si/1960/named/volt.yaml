  The volt is a derived SI unit for electric potential, voltage, and electromotive force equal to kg·m²·s⁻³·A⁻¹ in the 1960 SI base units.

  "The volt is the electric potential difference that exists between two points of a conducting wire carrying a constant current of one ampere when the power dissipated between these points is equal to one watt." [9th CGPM meeting in 1946]
