  The metre, or meter, is the SI base unit of length defined in terms of the wavelength of the radiation for a specific transition in krypton 86 as redefined at the 11th CGPM Meeting in 1960.

  "The metre is the length equal to 1650763.73 wavelengths in vacuum of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the levels 2p₁₀ and 5d₅ of the krypton 86 atom." [11th CGPM meeting (1960), resolution 6]
  The metre was adopted into SI at the 11th CGPM Meeting in 1960, resolution 12.
