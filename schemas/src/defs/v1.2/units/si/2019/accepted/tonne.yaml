description: |-
  A unit of mass defined as 1000 kg, with kilogram defined according to the 2019 SI units.

  The International System of Units (SI), 1st ed. (1970) defines the tonne as "1 t = 10³ kg" with the footnote "The symbol and the unit was defined in resolution 7 at the 9th meeting of the C.G.P.M. (1948)."

  In the 2019 implicit redefinition of the tonne, the kilogram in the definition refers to the 2019 kilogram SI base unit (https://schema.optimade.org/units/si/2019/named/kilogram).

  - The International System of Units (SI), 1st ed. (1970) categorizes the unit as "Units used with the International System"
  - The International System of Units (SI), 3rd ed. (19) changes the reference of the definition to the 1879 meeting of the CIPM page 41.
  - The International System of Units (SI), 6th ed. (1991) further adds "In some English-speaking countries this unit is called ≪metric ton≫."
