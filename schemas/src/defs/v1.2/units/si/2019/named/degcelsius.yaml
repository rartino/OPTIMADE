description: |-
  A derived SI unit of temperature, defined as kelvin offset with +273.15 in the 2019 SI units.

  "If we add to the practical international Celsius temperatures defined above T₀ = 273.15 degrees, we obtain the practical international Kelvin temperatures. By subtracting T₀ from the thermodynamic temperatures, we obtain the thermodynamic Celsius temperatures." [11th CGPM meeting (1960)]

  The degree Celsius was defined and included in SI at the 11th CGPM meeting in 1960, resolution 12 and implicitly redefined via the redefinitions of the kelvin at the 13th CGPM Meeting in 1967, resolution 4 and at the 26th CGPM Meeting (2018), resolution 1.
