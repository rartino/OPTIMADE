  A derived SI unit for energy, work, and heat equal to kg·m²·s⁻² in the 1983 SI units.

  "The joule is the work produced by a newton whose point of application moves one meter in the direction of the force." [9th CGPM meeting in 1946]

  The joule was defined at the 9th CGPM Meeting in 1946, included in SI at the 11th CGPM meeting in 1960, resolution 12, implicitly redefined via the redefinitions of the second at the 13th CGPM Meeting in 1967, resolution 1, the metre at the 17th CGPM meeting (1983), resolution 1, and the kilogram at the 26th CGPM Meeting (2018), resolution 1.
