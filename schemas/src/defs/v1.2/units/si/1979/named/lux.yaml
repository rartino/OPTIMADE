  A derived SI unit for illuminance equal to cd⋅sr⋅m⁻² in the 1979 SI units.

  "The lux is the illuminance of a surface that receives a uniformly distributed luminous flux of one lumen per square meter." [9th CGPM meeting in 1946]

  The lux was defined at the 9th CGPM meeting in 1946, and implicitly redefined via the redefinition of the second at the 13th CGPM Meeting in 1967, resolution 1 and the redefinition of the candela at the 16th CGPM Meeting in 1979, resolution 3.
