description: |-
  A symmetry operation given as general position x, y, z coordinates in algebraic form.

  **Requirements/Conventions:**

  - The symmetry operation is described by a string that gives that symmetry operation in Jones' faithful representation (Bradley & Cracknell, 1972: pp. 35-37), adapted for computer string notation.
  - The letters `x`, `y` and `z` that are typesetted with overbars in printed text represent coordinate values multiplied by -1 and are encoded as `-x`, `-y` and `-z`, respectively.
  - The syntax of the strings representing symmetry operations MUST conform to regular expressions given in appendix `The Symmetry Operation String Regular Expressions`_.
