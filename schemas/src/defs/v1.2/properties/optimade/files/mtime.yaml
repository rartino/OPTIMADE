description: |-
  Time of last modification of a file as per POSIX standard.

  **Requirements/Conventions:**

  - It should be noted that the values of `last_modified`, `modification_timestamp` and `mtime` do not necessary match.
    `last_modified` pertains to the modification of the OPTIMADE metadata, `modification_timestamp` pertains to file contents and `mtime` pertains to the modification of the file (not necessary changing its contents).
    For example, appending an empty string to a file would result in the change of `mtime` in some operating systems, but this would not be deemed as a modification of its contents.
examples:
  - "2007-04-05T14:30:20Z"
