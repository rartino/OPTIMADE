description: |-
  The three lattice vectors in Cartesian coordinates, in ångström (Å).

  **Requirements/Conventions**:

  - MUST be a list of three vectors *a*, *b*, and *c*, where each of the vectors MUST BE a list of the vector's coordinates along the x, y, and z Cartesian coordinates.
    (Therefore, the first index runs over the three lattice vectors and the second index runs over the x, y, z Cartesian coordinates).
  - For databases that do not define an absolute Cartesian system (e.g., only defining the length and angles between vectors), the first lattice vector SHOULD be set along *x* and the second on the *xy*-plane.
  - MUST always contain three vectors of three coordinates each, independently of the elements of property `dimension_types`.
    The vectors SHOULD by convention be chosen so the determinant of the `lattice_vectors` matrix is different from zero.
    The vectors in the non-periodic directions have no significance beyond fulfilling these requirements.
  - The coordinates of the lattice vectors of non-periodic dimensions (i.e., those dimensions for which `dimension_types` is `0`) MAY be given as a list of all `null` values.
    If a lattice vector contains the value `null`, all coordinates of that lattice vector MUST be `null`.

  **Explained examples**:

  - `[[4.0,0.0,0.0],[0.0,4.0,0.0],[0.0,1.0,4.0]]` represents a cell, where the first vector is (4, 0, 0), i.e., a vector aligned along the x axis of length 4 Å; the second vector is (0, 4, 0); and the third vector is (0, 1, 4).
examples:
  - [[4.0,0.0,0.0],[0.0,4.0,0.0],[0.0,1.0,4.0]]
