description: |-
  Cartesian positions of each site in the structure.

  A site is usually used to describe positions of atoms; what atoms can be encountered at a given site is conveyed by the `species_at_sites` property, and the species themselves are described in the `species` property.

  **Requirements/Conventions**:

  - It MUST be a list of length equal to the number of sites in the structure, where every element is a list of the three Cartesian coordinates of a site expressed as float values in the unit angstrom (Å).
  - An entry MAY have multiple sites at the same Cartesian position (for a relevant use of this, see e.g., the property `assemblies`).

  **Explained examples**:

  - `[[0,0,0],[0,0,2]]` indicates a structure with two sites, one sitting at the origin and one along the (positive) *z*-axis, 2 Å away from the origin.
examples:
  - [[0,0,0],[0,0,2]]
