description: |-
  A human- and machine-readable string containing the short Hermann-Mauguin (H-M) symbol which specifies the space group of the structure in the response.

  **Requirements/Conventions**:

  - The H-M symbol SHOULD aim to convey the closest representation of the symmetry information that can be specified using the short format used in the International Tables for Crystallography vol. A (IUCr, 2005), Table 4.3.2.1 as described in the accompanying text.
  - The symbol MAY be a non-standard short H-M symbol.
  - The H-M symbol does not unambiguously communicate the axis, cell, and origin choice, and the given symbol SHOULD NOT be amended to convey this information.
  - To encode as character strings, the following adaptations MUST be made when representing H-M symbols given in their typesetted form:

      - the overbar above the numbers MUST be changed to the minus sign in front of the digit (e.g. `-2`);
      - subscripts that denote screw axes are written as digits immediately after the axis designator without a space (e.g. `P 32`);
      - the space group generators MUST be separated by a single space (e.g. `P 21 21 2`);
      - there MUST be no spaces in the space group generator designation (i.e. use `P 21/m`, not the `P 21 / m`);
