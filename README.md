This repository contains the specification of the OPTiMaDe API.

* [optimade.rst](optimade.rst): The API specification.
* [AUTHORS](AUTHORS): List of contributors.

* [OPTiMaDe wiki](https://github.com/Materials-Consortia/OPTiMaDe/wiki): Information for developers

## For developers

The latest "stable" version of the specification is found in the [master](https://github.com/Materials-Consortia/OPTiMaDe/tree/master) branch.  
The latest "in development" version is found in the [develop](https://github.com/Materials-Consortia/OPTiMaDe/tree/develop) branch.

If you are a **server** developer, it is _recommended_ to always implement the latest stable version. It is also _recommended_ to implement the latest version in development.
You may want to use the same _master_ and _develop_ branch model employed here.

If you are a **client** developer, you are _encouraged_ to support at least the latest stable version, while it is _recommended_ to support the latest version in development.
You may want to use the same _master_ and _develop_ branch model employed here.
